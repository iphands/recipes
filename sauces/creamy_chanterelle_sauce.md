# Ingredients
- 6 oz chanterelle mushrooms
- 1 tbs butter
- 2 tbs finely minced shallots
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup white wine
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 tsp dried thyme
- 1/2 tsp cracked black peppercorns
- 1 tsp chicken bouillon granules
- Fresh parsley for garnish


# Instructions
Carefully clean the mushrooms. Dry-fry them in a pan until most of the moisture from mushrooms is cooked out. Set aside.

Melt the butter in the pan. Saute the shallots and garlic until tender, about 3 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients and the mushrooms and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the cover and continue to cook for another 5 minutes. Add more heavy cream for a thicker sauce, add more wine for a thinner sauce.

Generously rub the steaks with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Prepare a grill or cast iron ribbed pan. Grill on both sides for 3-5 minutes, or until desired doneness is reached.

Spoon the sauce over the steaks, garnish with chopped parsley, and serve immediately.
