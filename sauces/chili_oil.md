# Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups peanut oil
- 5 star anise
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 2 bay leaves
- 5 tablespoons Sichuan peppercorns
- 3/4 cups Red Pepper Flakes
- 1 tsp salt

# Directions
Place oil and all ingredients EXCEPT red pepper flakes and salt into a pot. Set it over medium heat to start, then progressively lower it to medium low or low heat as the oil comes to temperature. The oil should be at about 225째 F / 110째 C and causing small bubbles to slowly rise from the aromatics. If you notice the spices sizzling more vigorously than that or turning dark too quickly, take it off the heat until it cools down. If you are not achieving small bubbles, you can slowly move the temperature to 250째 F, but 200-225째 F is safest to prevent burning. Infuse this way for 30 minutes.

While the oil is infusing, prepare your red pepper flakes by placing them in a heatproof jar (16 oz mason jar works great). Add salt to jar along with red pepper flakes.

Once oil has infused for 30 minutes carefully pour the hot oil through a strainer onto the chili flakes. Stir to evenly distribute the heat of the oil. Cap jar once cool.
